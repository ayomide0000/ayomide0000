      <p class="card-text" style="color: black; margin-left: 40px; text-align: center; ">We offer a wide range of 
        benefits to the energy industry, Business to business B2B, Electric vehicles, 
        developing and underdeveloped countries, and the world 
        at large. Here are some of the benefits of the constant electric power energy system device; </p>

        <h5  style="margin-left: 20px;" class="card-title "><b>Clean Energy Source </b></h5>
        <p class="card-text" style="color: black; margin-left: 20px; ">
            The SHAKARZAHI Micro-power Constant Electric Energy System device is bringing 
            about significant change to clean energy usage in the United States and across the Globe. 
            The device invention is based solely on renewable energy sources to ensure clean energy
             generation that will be available to every homeowner and Business in the country
              and capable of growing globally as the benefit will attract global interest. <br><br>
            
            Our climate matters to us, and we want to contribute to our society by ensuring clean
             and environmentally friendly energy and climate protection. Reducing our carbon footprint
              is one of the practical approaches to providing clean energy, and this
               is what we have come to offer with our innovation.</p>
               <h5  style="margin-left: 20px;" class="card-title "><b>Eliminating Grid Crises Challenges </b></h5>
               <p class="card-text" style="color: black; margin-left: 20px; ">
                Despite the surge in power grid issues that may result in businesses or homes losing power,
                 the SHAKARZAHI Micro-power Constant Electric Energy System device can operate without the
                  grid, which makes it very beneficial for businesses, homeowners, and electric
                   vehicles (E.V.s). This device will eliminate problems that are now
                    existing with the grids. <br><br>
                
                Also, in areas where there are no grids, the device can efficiently function to produce power.
                 With the device, you have zero worries about the grid. Once you have the SHAKARZAHI 
                 Micro-power constant energy system device available, you have unlimited power access.
                  This innovation was carefully innovated to meet these demands and get power everywhere.
                   It is as simple as plugging in the device anywhere you are.
                </p>
                <h5  style="margin-left: 20px;" class="card-title "><b>Reducing Carbon Footprint</b></h5>
               <p class="card-text" style="color: black; margin-left: 20px; "> We understand the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions and make our
                 environment cleaner to ensure a  better  climate for all to live in. The SHAKARZAHI Micro-power constant energy system provides net zero carbon
                 emissions in both the generation process and power distribution. The device does not produce any pollution or carbon dioxide emissions, making it eligible for a safer form of electricity. <br><br>
                
                President Joe Biden reported a zero-carbon policy in his bid to achieve a net zero-carbon economy by
                 the year 
                2050. Embracing this policy is the right approach to freeing our environment from all the carbon foo
                tprints we acquire daily through our continued use of gas, coal, and fossil fuels. Our device can make achieving the policy easy because it ensures no carbon emission or pollution that can harm our climate. The device is suitable for homes, businesses, electric cars, trucks, and buses.
                </p>

               <h5  style="margin-left: 20px;" class="card-title "><b>Providing Employment Opportunities across the Globe</b></h5>
               <p class="card-text" style="color: black; margin-left: 20px; ">Business to Business will significantly benefit from the operation of the constant electric power energy system device as the organization's plan of action will be founded on them. In return, B2B organizations will give their items and administration to businesses generating a source of income for businesses. Also, the constant electric power energy industry requires diverse skills and professionals, making the industry a significant engine for job creation in the future.
                </p>

               <h5  style="margin-left: 20px;" class="card-title "><b>Eliminating Lithium Battery Storage Problems </b></h5>
               <p class="card-text" style="color: black; margin-left: 20px; "> The market has been overwhelmed with different batteries in which most of these batteries' processing has been linked to carbon emissions and environmental pollution. In our quest to eliminate carbon emissions as much as possible, the constant electric energy power system device doesn't require battery storage to function while providing an uninterruptible power supply.
                </p>

               <h5  style="margin-left: 20px;" class="card-title "><b>Highly Durable</b></h5>
               <p class="card-text" style="color: black; margin-left: 20px; "> The SHAKARZAHI Micro-power constant energy system device is designed to be durable and long-lasting with very low-cost maintenance. The lifespan is estimated to be 20 years while supplying any kilowatt of electrical power needed throughout its life span. This device will provide businesses and homes with the required electric power for more than 20 years without spending a fortune on routine maintenance. It is designed to accommodate low-cost maintenance.
